library(tidyverse)         # for graphing and data cleaning
library(lubridate)         # for working with dates
# library(remotes)        # for installing package from GitHub
# remotes::install_github("llendway/gardenR") # run if package is not already installed
library(gardenR)           # for Lisa's garden data
```
